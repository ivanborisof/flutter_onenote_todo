Customer Feedback:</br>
«Ivan has experience in performing the task I need, and, most importantly, he has good morals. Ivan is trustworthy, honest and patient with me. I can fully trust him to do the job and be honest when using my account for work. In addition, he can make sure that assignments are done perfectly, allowing me to test as well as providing recommendations until my app is released. This is my first experience with Ivan, and it certainly won't be my last»
